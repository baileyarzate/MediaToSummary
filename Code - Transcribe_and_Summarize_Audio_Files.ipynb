              "\" Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous People was passed through the United Nations, which was a huge victory. And all of these things, it's not like the bookend of a movement, but they were like benchmarks of like, okay, so the UN is limited in what it can do, so now what, now what, right? So all of those things happened, and we have to remember, even going to the George Floyd protests, the reason why it was spontaneous, but there was an infrastructure of resistance that was in place in that.  that was with the black community, with the indigenous community. And it was because of AIM, that you had that heightened consciousness around police violence. And also the Soul Patrol going back to the 60s and 70s of black organizers being against police violence in that city. And Mi'kawai communications was a radio station that the American Indian Movement had created in the city. And unfortunately it was burned to the ground of children, because of these moral ELECTrane, intellectual  the protests, not really quite sure, definitely was arson, but they raised money to rebuild it and they managed to save many of the important archival documents. And so, even with all of those divisions, AIM was still operating and I would say, and very much to this day is also operating, but I think those divisions really point to, and this is me kind of editorializing in this particular, on this particular issue, point to...  Two things. First of all, an internalized anti-communism of indigenous movements, specifically in the United States, not so much in Canada, but specifically the United States and the Red Power movement itself. And if you don't believe me, you should go read Lee Maracle's book, I Am Woman. She has a whole chapter on how the US indigenous movement internalized anti-communism and the way that it was mobilized specifically against indigenous women. So it had those...  really ugly elements to it, which were no doubt influenced by COINTELPRO and state repression. The second one is that no serious left or socialist movement in this country, like I can't really think of any socialist organization minus ours. And this is not me being sectarian, but just like the reason, it's the reason why we formed the Red Nation actually takes seriously the question of decolonization as a principle or an organizing principle of socialist politics.  within the United States, right? And so that is the lesson that we have to draw, but also to remember and not to map on Marxist or left political ideologies, because oftentimes there will be anarchists who will say like, oh, autonomous aims best represents anarchist philosophy. And I was like, no, I don't really think so. Just as much I would say, I don't think that it represents Marxist philosophy. I think that it has an organic anti-imperialism and an organic oil-  anti-colonialism that was very much sharpened and developed that actually transcended most left and socialist organizations and most anarchist organizations at the time that has to be respected. I encourage everyone to go back and read the newspapers that these organizations were publishing, that the children of these organizers were publishing. There's a really beautiful newspaper called Oyate Wichahou, which was written  It was actually edited by this Lebanese dude named Charles Abarisk, who was the son of James Abarisk, who was a senator at the time, who actually was kind of a side note, because we do live in different times. But he was a Lebanese, who was like, I think, the first Arab American senator in the US Congress, and he came from South Dakota, of all places. But he grew up on the Roosevelt Indian Reservation and had an affinity for indigenous politics and rights.  and he was actually like the most ardent defender of the PLO in the US Congress and also Hezbollah. He like would later on in life he'd give interviews and be like propping up Hezbollah. So much has changed. But his son was really taken in by the movement. He himself right now is actually he's a judge in the tribal court system in Pine Ridge. Charles at brisk and he has a law firm in Rapid City that does Indian rights or represent  But they had this newspaper called Oyate Wichahou, where they would talk about anti-imperialism, they would talk about the Sandinistas, the PLO, they would talk about the Black Panthers, they would talk about all of these different movements that were happening throughout the world. But they were also encouraging people to understand what it meant by decolonization, anti-imperialism. What is imperialism? What is capitalism? So there were those elements of anti-capitalism and anti-imperialism within those movements.  that definitely have to be respected, and our indigenous, you know, with a small eye to those particular political formations. And these things gave rise to things that we understand now as Native American studies or, you know, Native American and indigenous studies, or even the term indigenous, it came through struggle, it came through blood, it came through sacrifice, it came through death, assassination. People are still sitting inside of prisons, you know, so that we can, you and I can be.  having this conversation right now, that all has to be respected. We also have to understand the limitations of that kind of political formation and also understand the conditions in which it operated, right? And the divisions and why those divisions were created, but also why they were exploited by the colonizer and by these imperialists when it came down to it, right? And so we can't underestimate, you know, Amalcoer Cabral, famous saying or title to one of his...  essays, you know, tell no lies, claim no easy victories. And I really think that that's what you have to, you have to take into consideration, especially when you're studying the history of the American Indian movement. Yeah, absolutely. Nick, I could not have asked for a better guest to come on and cover this fascinating history. I was just absolutely learning so much from, from listening to you talk and you covered the legacy, what we can learn, um, the, the divisions and the splits. I think we could have you back on in the future.  specifically to talk about some of those documents about anti-communism and Marxism and and flesh out that even more a Weird thing that I just thought of when you were talking is in the early early days of rev left before I really had a big audience I somehow stumbled upon Ward Churchill and I reached out to him and there's a Early rev left like only patreon episode because I basically asked oh because I didn't know any of this You know so I was sort of like naive in my own way And I asked Ward Churchill like to introduce himself when he talked for an hour and a half  I'm unimpeded and I just put it up on patreon years ago and kind of forgot about it but now hearing all this history and all those connections between the Contras and libertarianism and Russell means I'm gonna go back and try to find that and just try to Understand what I actually talked to him about But yeah, all of that is so fascinating. Is there before I let you go and before I let you plug your your wonderful organization Is there anything else that you that you want to say anything you want to? finalize before we wrap up this  conversation? Yeah, I just want to say one thing about like, Russell Means and that like, I'm not trying to discredit his legacy, but I'm also just trying to tell the truth. And I think that's our obligation as historians, but also especially historians of the movement. And I will say that he, you know, to his dying days, he was a patriot, you know, and that has to be that means something, even despite the things that he did. And that goes for a lot of the American Indian movement is that we often look at  You know, I'll just say this. The we went from extermination to termination to self-determination. We're currently in the era of self-determination, right? And we are in a moment in time that I think AIM provided a pathway for us to struggle. And their pathway of struggle was beyond, you know, the horizon of the settler state or seeking recognition for the injuries that the settler state has caused and actually thought about nationhood.  I would say at this moment in time, maybe not within the last couple of months, but surely within the last two decades when AIM kind of fell out of favor and was no longer fashionable, but what was fashionable was to blame these indigenous revolutionaries for their failure, is that a generation went by where the horizon of struggle became the state itself and seeking further incorporation within that state structure.  And we are now seeing a return of a new horizon, I should say, beyond the settler state that AIM was always advocating for to begin with. And that to me is why I'm a Marxist and a communist, is because history, communism is proof that history hasn't ended, right? And it doesn't mean that like, you have to be a communist to make history, but it means that understanding that everyday people, you know, those...  those incarcerated inmates at Stillwater Prison could not have known the floodgates of history, the ripples. When they cast one stone, it made a ripple in the water in the pond. Then soon, millions of stones came after and created tidal waves of history. That's where we're at right now. I think that has to be respected no matter what your views on AMAR. Absolutely. Nick, I appreciate and admire you so much. Keep  Keep up the amazing work, definitely will have you back on. Before I let you go, can you please let listeners know where they can find you, your work, and The Red Nation online? Sure. So, The Red Nation podcast is currently publishing once a week. You can find it on iTunes, Spotify. We just created a new podcast series called The Red Power Hour, which is hosted by my partner Melanie and also co-founder of The Nation. We just had a beautiful interview with Amanda Blackhorse. You should all check it out. You can also just go to therednation.org.  to find out some more about our politics and positions on certain things. We're more active on social media. I don't run the social media accounts, but our comrades are so beautiful. Also, I'm not the leader of the organization. I'm now a American File member, and I'm just a content producer primarily. Find us on Instagram, find us on Facebook, find us on Twitter, find us on iTunes, and just support our work.  I also just want to say I've been listening to Rev. Left, you know, back in the day when you had the little folk punk introduction. I like actually has been very much influenced, you know, by your podcasting style, but also the fact that we need more voices on the left. So I really appreciate Rev. Left and also Red Menace and all the collaboration that you've done with other podcasts, you know, so props to you, Brett. And hopefully one day we get a meet in person. Absolutely. I would love that.  Thank you, that means so much coming from you. Long live the Red Nation and yeah, I can't wait for the day when we meet in person. Likewise.  supernatural power founders while their Yeah\""

            "[\"**Summary**\\n\\n- The Red Nation podcast announces the re-release of an archival episode about the American Indian Movement (AIM).\\n- AIM was founded in 1968 in Minneapolis to address child removal, police violence, and poverty.\\n- Founders like Clyde Belcourt and Dennis Banks were incarcerated prisoners who began organizing cultural and spiritual programs.\\n- AIM's early focus on urban Indigenous issues later evolved to include broader ideological points such as:\\n    - Advocacy for the abolition of the Bureau of Indian Affairs\\n    - Self-determination and sovereignty for Native Americans\\n    - Recognition of treaty rights\", \"**Ideological Underpinnings of the American Indian Movement (AIM)**\\n\\n* Sovereignty movements as a response to tyrannical oppression\\n* Christianity as a force of assimilation and genocide, particularly in the context of indigenous peoples\\n* Treaty rights and the struggle for recognition and protection\\n\\n**Origins of AIM**\\n\\n* Working-class roots and experience with class consciousness and anti-colonial politics\\n* Influence from indigenous leaders who had aligned with settler state interests\\n\\n**Unique Aspects of AIM**\\n\\n* Promotion of self-knowledge and self-love in the face of white supremacy\\n* Resistance to ongoing genocide and embracing indigenous identity\\n\\n**Historical Context Leading to AIM**\\n\\n* Longstanding tradition of indigenous resistance movements\\n* Early 20th century allotment system, reducing reservations and limiting indigenous rights\\n* Court of Indian Offenses and civilization regulations, criminalizing indigenous practices\\n* Off-reservation boarding school system, aimed at eradicating indigenous cultures\\n* New Deal programs with good intentions but often assimilationist in nature\\n* National Council of American Indians (NCAI), formed to address termination threats\\n* World War II service and exposure to global colonization, sparking frustration and activism\\n* National Indian Youth Council and Clyde Warrior's introduction of decolonization and sovereignty concepts\\n* Fiscan protests in the Northwest, challenging state game wardens' infringement on fishing rights\", \"**AIM's Origins and Goals**\\n- Inspired by civil rights activists and earlier indigenous organizations, particularly the National Indian Youth Council.\\n- Tactics included sit-ins and occupations.\\n- Composed primarily of Anishinaabe, Dakota, and Lakota people from the North.\\n- Responded to termination and relocation policies that aimed to dissolve tribes and move Indians off reservations.\\n- Urban Indian centers became hubs of political organization and cultural revitalization.\\n- Saw themselves as part of an unbroken line of indigenous resistance.\\n\\n**Termination Policy**\\n- Government policy in the 1950s and 1960s that aimed to end the reservation system and assimilate Indians into mainstream society.\\n- Involved the liquidation of some tribes and a relocation program that sent Indians to urban centers.\\n\\n**Boarding School Legacy**\\n- Government-run boarding schools aimed to assimilate Indian children into white society.\\n- Children were forcibly removed from their families, forced to cut their hair and speak English only, and often subjected to abuse.\\n- Destroyed family relationships and cultural identity.\\n- Led to loss of traditional knowledge and language.\", '**Anti-Colonial Movement and Partnerships**\\n\\n* AIM emerged as part of a broader anti-colonial movement.\\n* In Minneapolis, AIM partnered with the Soul Patrol, a black organization filming police brutality against black communities.\\n\\n**Education and Public Surveillance**\\n\\n* AIM addressed public education as a site of surveillance for indigenous children.\\n* They established \"survival schools\" to provide Indian education and autonomy within the community.\\n\\n**Health, Housing, Employment, and Legal Advocacy**\\n\\n* AIM founded urban Indian health and housing boards.\\n* They created the Little Earth housing unit to provide affordable housing for Indian families.\\n* They created the Legal Rights Center to advocate for employment rights and fight discrimination.\\n\\n**Community Organizational Work**\\n\\n* AIM engaged in \"on the ground\" community organizing, working to address everyday needs of indigenous communities.\\n* This included employment support, community patrols, and health initiatives.\\n\\n**Influence on Civil Rights and Politics**\\n\\n* The Legal Rights Center served as an incubator for civil rights lawyers and politicians, including Keith Ellison, who prosecuted Derek Chauvin in the George Floyd case.\\n\\n**Ideology and Political Affiliations**\\n\\n* AIM initially focused on civil rights but later adopted more militant tactics.\\n* The organization lacked a specific political ideology but generally espoused an anti-colonialist stance.\\n* While they were sympathetic to organizations like the Black Panther Party, AIM believed they lacked a full understanding of settler colonialism.\\n\\n**Actions and Alliances**\\n\\n* AIM engaged in direct action tactics, including the takeover of Bureau of Indian Affairs offices.\\n* They worked with organizations like the Soul Patrol and, in later years, the Young Lords.', \"- **Colonial Administrators and BIA Occupations:**\\n    - Advocates for the abolition of the BIA\\n    - Demanded employment of Indian people in administrative roles\\n\\n-

an Indian embassy\\n    - Stole BIA archives containing evidence of Indian claims\\n\\n- **AIM's Reputation and Influence:**\\n    - Established itself as a national organization\\n    - Became known for its willingness to engage in radical actions\\n\\n- **Border Town Violence and the Murder of Raymond Yellow Thunder:**\\n    - Symbol of discrimination and genocidal violence against indigenous people\\n    - Led to increased activism and advocacy by AIM\", '**Summary:**\\n\\n- The American Indian Movement (AIM) targeted border town economies in South Dakota as part of an anti-capitalist and anti-colonial critique.\\n- AIM viewed border towns as places where white society criminalized and marginalized Native Americans, particularly those who were drunk.\\n- The police practice of \"Indian rolling,\" where Native Americans were told to leave town or face violence, was part of this systemic discrimination.\\n- AIM established \"Red Ribbon Grand Juries,\" which held symbolic trials for individuals who discriminated against Native Americans.\\n- AIM\\'s support for Wesley Badheart-Bull, a Native American murdered in a bar, led to a confrontation with police in Custer, South Dakota.\\n- The confrontation escalated into violence, with arrests of AIM members and the burning of buildings.\\n- AIM\\'s tactics and targets were controversial, but they brought attention to the racism and discrimination faced by Native Americans in border towns.\\n- The incident at Custer marked a turning point in AIM\\'s history and contributed to the eventual occupation of Wounded Knee in 1973.', \"- AIM members forced entry into the courthouse after being barred by police.\\n- A physical confrontation ensued, with AIM members using confiscated night sticks against law enforcement.\\n- Protesters set the courthouse ablaze, causing significant damage.\\n- AIM's actions created tensions within the Oglala Lakota dissidents on Pine Ridge.\\n- South Dakota formed a task force to address

Wilson.\\n- The Oglala Sioux Civil Rights Commission, led by traditionalist leaders, called on AIM to assist in their struggle against Wilson's authoritarian rule.\\n- Women leaders, including Regina Brave and Gladys Bissonnet, played a pivotal role in advocating for action and demanding a stand.\\n- AIM occupied Wounded Knee on February 27, 1973, as a symbolic act of resistance and a call for indigenous rights.\\n- The FBI monitored AIM's activities closely, using COINTELPRO tactics to sow paranoia and disruption within the movement.\\n- Internal conflicts arose within AIM regarding the use of firearms, with some members, such as Fools Crow, opposing their use.\", \"**AIM Occupation of Wounded Knee**\\n\\n- **Background:**\\n    - Creditor within the community accused of mistreating indigenous people (wife was from Turtle Mountain)\\n    - AIM liberated pawned ceremonial items from the creditor's store, causing $2 million in property damage\\n    - AIM took over the grocery store for sustenance\\n\\n- **Declaration of Independence:**\\n    - March 8th, 1973: AIM and traditional Oglala leaders declared the independent Oglala Nation\\n    - Based on the Fort Laramie Treaty
